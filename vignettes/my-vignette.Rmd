## Introduction 

This will walk you through how to use the package nbTransmission to analyze an infectious disease outbreak. You want to start by installing nbTransmission if you have not already done so using:

```{r setup1, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github('sarahleavitt/nbTransmission')
```

Then you can load the package by running:

```{r setup2}
library('nbTransmission')
```

If you want the results to match mine, set your seed to match:

```{r seed}
set.seed(0)
```


This package implements an algorithm that takes a dataset of ordered possible infector-infectee pairs from an infectious disease outbreak or outbreak cluster and estimates the relative probability the cases are linked by direct transmission using a classification technique called naive Bayes (NB).

**Naive Bayes** is a simple and popular machine learning algorithm that uses Bayes rule to estimate the probability of an outcome in a prediction dataset given a set of covariates from the observed frequencies in a training dataset. It is a two step process:

1. Determine the association between the outcome and the covariates in a training dataset where the outcome is known.
1. Estimate the probability of the outcome given the covariates in a prediction dataset where the outcome is not known.
 
In this context, a subset of cases with pathogen whole genome sequence (WGS) or contact investigation data serve as the training dataset and the outcome is if the pair is "linked" by one or both of these metrics which is a proxy for being linked by direct transmission. The covariates can be any categorical variables and could represent spatial, clinical, demographic, and temporal characteristics of the cases. The goal is to use these covariates to predict the probability that pairs are linked even when we do not have any WGS or contact data.
 
Because the outcomes in the training set represent probable and not certain transmission events and a given case could have mulitple probable infectors, we use an iterative estimation procedure. This procedure randomly chooses one link of all of the possible links to include in the training dataset multiple times, and then uses mxn cross prediction to give all pairs a turn in the prediction dataset.



## Creating a Dataset of Pairs

Lets say you have a dataset of individuals from an outbreak. We are going to use a simulated dataset called indData provided with the dataset. This dataset has 100 individuals and contains an ID variable, a variable with the true infector (because this is simulated data so we know the truth), the infection date and time, the sampling date and time, and four covariates (X1-X4). The covariates are artificial but were designed to resemble some possible covariates in real applications.

```{r indData}
data(indData)
str(indData)
```

Now we need to create a dataset of all ordered pairs of cases to analyze. The package includes a function called indToPair which will do exactly this. The function takes an individual-level dataset and creates a pair-level dataset. You tell the function the name of the ID column and the resulting dataset will have an pair ID column that combines the two individual IDs. It will also include all other columns with the suffixes ".1" and ".2" corresponding to the two individuals in the pair. If you specify a date column it will also find the time difference between the pairs and if you set ordered to TRUE, it will only include pairs where the date for individual 1 is before individual 2. Here is how you would use this function and the result.

```{r indToPair}
pairDataRaw <- indToPair(indData,
                         indIDVar = "individualID",
                         separator = "_",
                         dateVar = "infectionDate",
                         ordered = FALSE)
str(pairDataRaw)
```


The next step is to create pair-level equivalents of the covariates. This can be done in any way that is clinically meaningful. For example if the individual-level covariate was nationality, the pair-level covariate could be do the individuals have the same nationality or not. If the individual-level covariate was town of residence, the pair-level covariate could be are the individuals in the same town, neighboring town, or further away. Currently the method only supports pair-level covariates that are categorical and they need to also be factor variables.

Pair-level covariates for this dataset are already stored in pairData, the other dataset included in the package. and this is the dataset we are going to analyze. The pairData dataset also has a column called snpDist with the number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) separating the pathogen of the two individuals, a categorical representation of infectionTimeDiff, as well as a column called transmission indicating if the pair is a true transmission pair (because again this is simulated data so we know this!).

Here are details about the individual-level covariates and how they were transformed into pair-level covariates. They were simulated to be associated with transmission in different degrees.

Variable | Individual-level | Pair-level  | Possible motivation |
:-------:| :--------------: | :---------: | :-----------------: | 
X1/Z1 | 2 options: a, b | Z1 = 1 if same <br> Z1 = 0 if different | Sex |
X2/Z2 | 4 options: a, b, c, d | Z2 = 0 if same <br> Z2 = 0 if different | Nationality |
X3/Z3 | 2 options: a, b | Z3 = 1 if a-a <br> Z3 = 2 if b-b <br> Z3 = 3 if a-b <br> Z4 = 4 if b-a | homelessness |
X4/Z4 | 10 options: a-j | Z4 = 1 if same <br> Z4 = 2 if adjacent <br> Z4 = 3 if other | county of residence |


Here are the distributions of the individual-level covariates:

```{r indCovariates}
prop.table(table(indData$X1))
prop.table(table(indData$X2))
prop.table(table(indData$X3))
prop.table(table(indData$X4))
```

And the pair-level covariates by whether or not the pair is a true transmission pair (TRUE) or not (FALSE)

```{r pairCovariates}
prop.table(table(pairData$transmission, pairData$Z1), 1)
prop.table(table(pairData$transmission, pairData$Z2), 1)
prop.table(table(pairData$transmission, pairData$Z3), 1)
prop.table(table(pairData$transmission, pairData$Z4), 1)
```




## Estimating Relative Transmission Probabilties

There are two more data preparation steps that we need to do before we are ready to find the relative transmission probabilities. First we need subset the pair dataset to only ordered pairs (if you are using the indToPair function, you can use the ordered = TRUE option and skip this step!)

```{r ordered}
pairDataOrdered <- pairData[pairData$infectionDiff > 0, ]
```

Next we need to create the variable that defines probable links for our training dataset. In our dataset, we will use the SNP distance to define probable links. We are going to say that pairs with fewer than 3 SNPs will be considered probable links and pairs with more than 10 SNPs are considered non-linked. Any pairs with 3-10 SNPs will be considered indeterminate and not included in the training set. Those pairs as well as any pairs without WGS info will only be use in the prediction dataset. The variable that defines the probable links should be a logical with TRUE indicating a link and FALSE inidicating a non-link.

```{r snpClose}
pairDataOrdered$snpClose <- ifelse(pairDataOrdered$snpDist < 3, TRUE,
                                   ifelse(pairDataOrdered$snpDist > 10, FALSE, NA))
prop.table(table(pairDataOrdered$snpClose, useNA = "ifany"))
```

Now we can use the function nbTransmission to calculate the relative transmission probabilities for all pairs, training the model using the WGS data. I want to highlight a few things about the function arguments. For indIDVar, the function looks for that value with the suffix ".1" and ".2" in the pair dataframe (which would have been automatically created if you used indToPair to create the pair-level dataframe). The options n, m, and nReps indicate how many times the iterative procedure. This procedure randomly chooses one link of all of the possible links to include in the training dataset nReps times, and then uses mxn cross prediction for each training dataset to give all pairs a turn in the prediction dataset. Therefore in total you run naive Bayes nReps * n * m times. **In this tutorial, nReps = 1 for computational efficiency but nReps should be at least 10.** 

```{r probabilities, results="hide"}
resGen <- nbProbabilities(orderedPair = pairDataOrdered,
                            indIDVar = "individualID",
                            pairIDVar = "pairID",
                            goldStdVar = "snpClose",
                            covariates = c("Z1", "Z2", "Z3", "Z4", "timeCat"),
                            label = "SNPs", l = 1,
                            n = 10, m = 1, nReps = 1)
```

```{r probabilities2}
str(resGen)
```


The results are a list with two dataframes, the first of which containing the average and scaled relative transmission probabilities. We can extract that dataframe and merge it back with our pair-level dataset for further analysis. We can see that the algorithm assigned much higher probabilities to the true transmission pairs than the rest of the pairs.


```{r combine}
nbResults <- merge(resGen$probabilities, pairDataOrdered, by = "pairID", all = TRUE)
tapply(nbResults$pScaled, nbResults$transmission, summary)
```

```{r results, fig.width=7, fig.height=3}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = nbResults, aes(x = pScaled)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 20) +
  facet_wrap(~transmission, scales = "free_y")
```

## Estimating the Reproductive Number

One way to use the probabilities is to estimate the reproductive number. This package includes a function estimateR which estimates the individual-level, time-level, and overall average effective reproductive numbers. 

```{r rInitial}
rInitial <- estimateR(nbResults,
                      dateVar = "infectionDate",
                      indIDVar = "individualID",
                      pVar = "pScaled",
                      timeFrame = "months")
str(rInitial)
```

Note the message that is printed when running this funciton without specifying rangeForAvg. In order to get a more accurate estimate of the average effective reproductive number, you only want to use the stable portion of the outbreak. You can use a plot of the Rt values over time to find this portion of the outbreak. In this case I want to exclude start at month 25 and end at month 125 which is excluding about the first 10% and last 20% of the outbreak.

```{r cutting, fig.height = 3.5, fig.width = 6}
cut1 <- 25
cut2 <- 125

plotRt(rInitial)
```

Then I can rerun the estimateR function specifying the range for the average and also asking for bootstrap confidence intervals.

```{r rFinal, results = "hide"}
rFinal <- estimateR(nbResults, dateVar = "infectionDate",
             indIDVar = "individualID", pVar = "pScaled",
             timeFrame = "months", rangeForAvg = c(cut1, cut2),
             bootSamples = 10, alpha = 0.05)
```

```{r rFinal2}
rFinal$RtAvgDf
```


Then you can plot the final results.

REPLACE WITH VISUALIZATION FUNCTION ONCE WRITTEN

```{r, fig.height = 3.5, fig.width = 6}
plotRt(rFinal, includeRtAvg = TRUE, includeRtCI = TRUE, includeRtAvgCI = TRUE)
```
