\title{Estimates the average effective reproductive number}
\usage{
calcRtAvg(rtData, rangeForAvg = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{rtData}{The name of the dateset with time-level reproductive numbers.}

\item{rangeForAvg}{A vector with the start and ending time period to be used to calculate the
average effective reproductive number.}
}
\value{
A dataframe with the average effective reproductive. Column names:
     \itemize{
       \item \code{RtAvg} - the average time-level reproductive number between the range
        specified in \code{rangeForAvg}.
     }
