\title{Executes the PEM algorthim to estimate the serial interval distribution}
\usage{
performPEM(df, indIDVar, timeDiffVar, pVar, initialPars, shift = 0,
  epsilon = 1e-05, plot = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{The name of the dateset with transmission probabilities.}

\item{indIDVar}{The name (in quotes) of the individual ID columns
(data frame \code{df} must have variables called \code{<indIDVar>.1}
 and \code{<indIDVar>.2}).}

\item{timeDiffVar}{The name (in quotes) of the column with the difference
in time between symptom onset (or its proxy) for the pair of cases. The
units of this variable (hours, days, years) defines the units of the resulting
SI distribution.}

\item{pVar}{The column name (in quotes) of the transmission probabilities.}

\item{initialPars}{A vector of length two with the shape and scale 
to initialize the gamma distribution parameters.}

\item{shift}{A value in the same units as \code{timeDiffVar} that the
gamma distribution should be shifted. The Default value of 0 is a 
standard gamma distribution.}

\item{epsilon}{The difference between successive estimates of the shape and
scale parameters that indicates convergence.}

\item{plot}{A logical indicating if a plot should be printed showing the
parameter estimates at each iteration.}
}
\value{
A data frame with one row and the following columns:
\itemize{
   \item \code{nInd} - the number of infectees who have SIs included
   in the SI estimate.
   \item \code{shape} - the shape of the estimated gamma distribution for the SI.
   \item \code{scale} - the scale of the estimated gamma distribution for the SI.
   \item \code{meanSI} - the mean of the estimated gamma distribution for the SI 
   (\code{shape * scale + shift})
   \item \code{medianSI} - the median of the estimated gamma distribution for the SI
   (\code{qgamma(0.5, shape, scale) + shift)})
   \item \code{sdSI} - the standard deviation of the estimated gamma distribution for
   the SI (\code{shape * scale ^ 2})
 }
}
\description{
The function \code{performPEM} uses relative transmission probabilities to estimate
the serial interval distribution
}
\details{
This function is meant to be called by \code{\link{estimateSI}}
which estimates the serial interval distribution as well as clustering the
probabilities but can be called directly. The main reason to call \code{performPEM}
directly is for the \code{plot} argument. Setting this argument to \code{TRUE}
will produce a plot of the shape and scale parameters at each iteration.
For more details on the PEM algorithm see \code{\link{estimateSI}}.

\examples{

## Use the nbResults data frame included in the package which has the results
## of the nbProbabilities() function on a TB-like outbreak.

## Estimating the serial interval

# Using all pairs and plotting the parameters
performPEM(nbResults, indIDVar = "individualID", timeDiffVar = "infectionDiffY",
pVar = "pScaled", initialPars = c(2, 2), shift = 0, plot = TRUE)

# Clustering the probabilities first
allClust <- clusterInfectors(nbResults, indIDVar = "individualID", pVar = "pScaled",
                            clustMethod = "hc_absolute", cutoff = 0.05)

performPEM(allClust[allClust$cluster == 1, ], indIDVar = "individualID",
           timeDiffVar = "infectionDiffY", pVar = "pScaled",
           initialPars = c(2, 2), shift = 0, plot = TRUE)
           
# The above is equivalent to the following code using the function estimateSI()
# though the plot will not be printed and more details will be added
estimateSI(nbResults, indIDVar = "individualID", timeDiffVar = "infectionDiffY",
          pVar = "pScaled", clustMethod = "hc_absolute", cutoff = 0.05,
          initialPars = c(2, 2))
